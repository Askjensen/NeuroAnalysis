# NeuroAnalysis
A package to effectively model viewer arrousal based on galvanic skin conductance (GSR) and eyetracking (pupil-dilation) data.

Scinconductance_skabalon is a collection of functions to allow for moddelling and plotting of SC-data from Tobii-eyetracking and BSS (.csv textfiler). 

The code structure is as a python project and readily opens in eg. PyCharm. The code is documentet to some extend.

There is a set of harcodded definitions and controlparameters in bin/definitions.py (path to data and list of sequences to analyses etc.There exists a few 
hardcoded parameteres in Fysiologisk/Fysiologisk.py' (main).

The structure for unit/integration tests is in place, but not tests have yet been setup.
